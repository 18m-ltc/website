# Hosting a hangout

If you want to host a hangout, here's the procedure

* Schedule hangout on air (instructions here)
* Start it 5 minutes before to ensure that you can share your
  presentation, and that everything works ok.
* Afterwards, you can host the video on your own youtube channel, or
  send it to me. If you want to host it yourself, you'll want to edit
  the final product (instructions here). If you want me to edit/host it,
  download the mp4 and send it to me (instructions here).

Other stuff:

* Promoting hangout
* Promoting video afterwards

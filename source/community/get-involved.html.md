# Get Involved

Help us make the RDO community site a great place for users and cloud operators in the Red Hat ecosystem by sharing your OpenStack questions and solutions on [ask.openstack](http://ask.openstack.org), and by adding [the most useful solutions](Troubleshooting) and [stories](Case_studies) to the RDO website.

### Discuss and stay informed

Come and chat real-time with RDO users on **IRC**—you can usually find us in the #rdo channel—or hanging out with the wider OpenStack community in the #openstack channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net). Packstack-specific discussion takes place in the #packstack-dev channel.

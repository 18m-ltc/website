# RDO Doc Days

We periodically run RDO Doc Days, when we encourage people to improve
the documentation and the website by spending an hour or two looking for
errors, outdated information, or anything else that could be better.

Thanks to everyone who participatd in the January doc day. Keep watching
here for the dates of the February doc day.

Meanwhile, you can always work on the [open
issues](https://github.com/redhat-openstack/website/issues).

# RDO Doc Days

We periodically run RDO Doc Days, when we encourage people to improve
the documentation and the website by spending an hour or two looking for
errors, outdated information, or anything else that could be better.

The next one will be **January 20th and 21st**. Check out the [open
issues list](https://github.com/redhat-openstack/website/issues) for
inspiration for what to work on.

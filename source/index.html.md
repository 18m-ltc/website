## Introducing RDO

![`openstack-distribution.png`](openstack-distribution.png "openstack-distribution.png")

RDO is a community of people using and deploying OpenStack on Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Fedora and distributions derived from these (such as CentOS, Scientific Linux and others). We have [ documentation to help get started](Docs), [/forum forums] where you can connect with other users, and [ community-supported packages](Quickstart) of the most up-to-date OpenStack releases available for download.

If you are looking for enterprise-level support, or information on partner certification, Red Hat also offers [Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform](//redhat.com/openstack).

OpenStack relies on the underlying operating system and hypervisor — and what better operating system to build on than the industry's leading enterprise operating system? The RDO community is your one-stop community site for all things related to using OpenStack on Red Hat based platforms.

## RDO Test Day (January 7th and 8th)

Next week (January 7/8) we'll be doing our first [RDO_test_day_January_2014 | Icehouse test day], and we'd appreciate it if you could help us out with an hour or two of your time. Details on the test day can be found at [RDO_test_day_January_2014](RDO_test_day_January_2014) and a matrix of what we'd like to test is at [TestedSetups_2014_01](TestedSetups_2014_01).

Thanks for any time you can contribute to this testing effort, to help make RDO as solid as possible.

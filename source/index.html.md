## Introducing RDO

![`openstack-distribution.png`](openstack-distribution.png "openstack-distribution.png")

RDO is a community of people using and deploying OpenStack on Red Hat and Red Hat-based platforms. We have [ documentation to help get started](Docs), [/forum forums] where you can connect with other users, and [ community-supported packages](Quickstart) of the most up-to-date OpenStack releases available for download.

If you are looking for enterprise-level support, or information on partner certification, Red Hat also offers [Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform](//redhat.com/openstack).

OpenStack relies on the underlying operating system and hypervisor — and what better operating system to build on than the industry's leading enterprise operating system? The RDO community is your one-stop community site for all things related to using OpenStack on Red Hat based platforms.

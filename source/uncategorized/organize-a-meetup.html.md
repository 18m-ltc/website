# Organize an RDO/OpenStack Meetup

A fan of RDO and OpenStack? Want to spread the word? Become a co-organizer of an OpenStack meetup!

There are OpenStack meetup groups all over the world, with more forming all the time. If there isn't a meetup in your area, we encourage you to start your own. We are committed to the success of these groups, and will do everything in our power to make your OpenStack meetup a successful one.

### Organizing an OpenStack Meetup: The Playbook

Step 1: Check the list of [current OpenStack meetups](http://www.meetup.com/find/events/?allMeetups=false&keywords=OpenStack&radius=Infinity&userFreeform=Lexington%2C+KY&mcId=z40502&eventFilter=all). If there's already a meet-up in your area, join it and help to spread the word.

Step 2: No OpenStack meetup in your area? Create one on [meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com/) and [tell us about it](mailto:rdo-list@redhat.com)!

Step 3: We want to be sure that meetup organizers are committed to building a strong local community of OpenStack users. After a brief discussion, we will create the OpenStack meetup group in your area, appoint you as a co-organizer, and announce your new group to the world. We will also ship you an OpenStack meetup kit with everything you will need to get started.

Step 4: Secure a date and location for your first meetup! We will help you by spreading the word on social media, reaching out to potential speakers and sponsors in your area, and suggesting new and interesting OpenStack content on a regular basis.

Supporting Your Local OpenStack Meetup

Already an OpenStack meetup group in your area? There are a number of ways you can help.

If you are an experienced user, consider giving a talk. Sharing expertise is what makes meetups so valuable. Even if you're never given a presentation before, there are dozens of OpenStack presentations in the wild, given by other OpenStack users, that can serve as models for your own presentation.

If you are an enthusiast, participate actively in your local meetup. Ask good questions. Help spread the word. Share pictures. Tweet about what you're learning, or write a blog post.

If you are a business, consider hosting or sponsoring. Meetups don't happen without places to have them, and everyone appreciates food at a meetup. It's also a good way to get your company's name out there as an innovative workplace that encourages and supports open source development. If you'd like to host, send us an email and we will put you in touch with OpenStack enthusiasts in your area.

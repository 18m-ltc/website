# Tuskar-UI

The Tuskar UI is a management interface for OpenStack deployments. The deployment methodology is based upon [TripleO](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/TripleO) and [Tuskar](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Tuskar); these in turn rely on OpenStack services such as Glance, Nova, and Heat.

The Tuskar UI is developed as a plugin for OpenStack Horizon; as such it is Django-based and stateless.

## Features

Key features of the Tuskar-UI include:

*   **Overcloud management** Plan and deploy your overcloud entirely through the UI.
*   **Node management:** Create an inventory of nodes through direct user input or bulk CSV upload. Use auto-discovery to have node attributes filled in for you. View summary statistics of current node usage, and detailed historical statistics for specific nodes.
*   **Role management:** Manage and update the flavors and images used by the compute, controller, object storage, and block storage roles.
*   **History:** View historical information about the overcloud deployment, as well as historical usage statistics for provisioned nodes.

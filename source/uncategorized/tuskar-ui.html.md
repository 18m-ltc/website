# Tuskar-UI

The Tuskar UI is a management interface for OpenStack deployments. The deployment methodology is based upon Tuskar and TripleO; these in turn rely on OpenStack services such as Glance, Nova, and Heat.

The Tuskar UI is developed as a plugin for OpenStack Horizon; as such it shares many characteristics including being Django-based and stateless.

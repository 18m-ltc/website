# Tuskar-UI

The Tuskar UI is a management interface for OpenStack deployments. The deployment methodology is based upon [TripleO](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/TripleO) and [Tuskar](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Tuskar); these in turn rely on OpenStack services such as Glance, Nova, and Heat.

The Tuskar UI is developed as a plugin for OpenStack Horizon; as such it is Django-based and stateless.

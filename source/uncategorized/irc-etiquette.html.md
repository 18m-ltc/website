# IRC etiquette

## IRC communitcation guidelines and etiquette

### Guidelines

These are just some guidelines so you get a perspective of IRC culture, communication:

*   Try to ask smart questions, let us try to think for ourselves first and not let some poor, good-intentioned soul to do all the thinking for us. [Pro-tip: Eric S. Raymond's guide referred in the **Resources** section]
*   Try (as humanly as possible) to be: clear, concrete, specific and *complete* with your statements/questions. People cannot read your minds.
*   Be patient: do not expect people will devote time for extreme hand-holding. If a URL is pointed, please try things yourself, do your home-work, use Google *effectively*.
*   Try to maintain a balance of *taking* vs *giving* from the community. Do not demand excessive attention.
*   IRC is a DIY environment, not a paid-support forum. If someone responds to you, that is a bonus.
*   Be reminded: respect people's time, always answering IRC questions isn't developers first priority. Someone could be knee deep in gdb/pdb investigating that time-critical bug.
*   When in a community environment, just post the question to the channel, you do not have to ping a specific person just because he/she answered your question before. Nor do you have to ask questions like "Anyone alive on this channel?" "Are you using ABC?" Stay channel topic related!
*   It is an international channel: you may get better responses in certain timezones, be patient - don't count on instant reactions.

All of the above look dead obvious, but doesn't instantly come to mind when asking questions in a public IRC. And, sure - we also understand we are all human, already overwhelmed and sometimes, we *Just Need* that answer and not want to follow any heavy instructions. If you're lucky, you might even have the bonus of getting it answered instantly.

### Resources

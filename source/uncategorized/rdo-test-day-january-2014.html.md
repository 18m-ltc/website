# RDO test day January 2014

We plan to hold a RDO test day on January 7th and 8th, 2014. This will be coordinated through the #rdo channel on Freenode, and through this wiki and the [rdo-list mailing list](http://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/rdo-list).

We'll be testing the first Icehouse milestone release, and we'd like to test the scenarios enumerated below. If you can do any testing on your own ahead of time, that will help ensure that everyone isn't encountering the same problems.

## Who's Participating

*Add your name, and how you're able to help out*

*   rbowen (Rich Bowen) - Testing, IRC, Documentation

## Prerequisite for Test Day

We'll have packages for the following platforms:

*   F19
*   F20
*   RHEL 6.5
*   RHEL 7 beta
*   CentOS 6
*   CentOS 6.5

You'll want a fresh install with latest updates installed. (Fresh so that there's no hard-to-reproduce interactions with other things.)

## How To Test

The things that should be tested are listed on the [Tested Setups](TestedSetups_2014_01) page.

*   Pick an item from the list
*   Go through the scenario as though you were a beginner, just following the instructions
*   KEEP GOOD NOTES. You can use <https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/rdo_test_day_jan_2014> for these notes. Reviewing other peoples' notes may help you avoid problems that they've already encountered.

If you have problems with any of the tests, report a bug to [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.redhat.com) usually for one of the [openstack-packstack](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/enter_bug.cgi?product=RDO&version=18&component=openstack-packstack), [openstack-nova](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/enter_bug.cgi?product=RDO&version=18&component=openstack-nova), [openstack-glance](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/enter_bug.cgi?product=RDO&version=18&component=openstack-glance), [openstack-keystone](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/enter_bug.cgi?product=RDO&version=18&component=openstack-keystone), [openstack-cinder](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/enter_bug.cgi?product=RDO&version=18&component=openstack-cinder), [openstack-neutron](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/enter_bug.cgi?product=RDO&version=18&component=openstack-neutron),[openstack-swift](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/enter_bug.cgi?product=RDO&version=18&component=openstack-swift) or [openstack-heat](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/enter_bug.cgi?product=RDO&version=18&component=openstack-heat) or [openstack-ceilometer](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/enter_bug.cgi?product=RDO&version=18&component=openstack-ceilometer) components. If you are unsure about exactly how to file the report or what other information to include, just ask on IRC (#rdo, freenode.net) and we will help you.

Once you have completed the tests, add your results to the table on the [TestedSetups_2014_01](TestedSetups_2014_01) page, following the examples already there. Be sure to check the [Workarounds](Workarounds) page for things that may have already have fixes or workarounds.

## Blogs, Screencasts

We strongly encourage you to write narrative blogs about your test experiences, whether this is about the test day itself, or a howto style post about a particular install/test scenario. Link to those posts here.

Also, if you'd like to do an audio interview for a podcast about this event, please contact Rich Bowen (rbowen at redhat dot com) to set something up.

Use something like RecordMyDesktop to record a screencast of your tests, and let me (rbowen) know if you have any video that you think would make useful HowTo videos.

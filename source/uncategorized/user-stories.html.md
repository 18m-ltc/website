[CERN](http://openstack-in-production.blogspot.com/) has more than 50,000 cores running OpenStack using RDO for deployment.

''[A co-worker] and I have been spiking out OpenStack and out of all the Distro's available, without any doubt (obviously as its from Redhat) RDO is the best for the following reasons:-

1. Idempotent 2. Best Documentation 3. Helpful forums providing working solutions.

The work done on Packstack is admirable, this makes us to wonder why someone would want to use DevStack. ''

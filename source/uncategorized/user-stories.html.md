[CERN](http://openstack-in-production.blogspot.com/) has more than 50,000 cores running OpenStack using RDO for deployment.

*We use the RDO client packages on our Linux machines. The upgrade was a change of repository and yum update.* -- [OpenStack In Production blog](http://openstack-in-production.blogspot.com/)

"[A co-worker] and I have been spiking out OpenStack and out of all the Distro's available, without any doubt (obviously as it's from Redhat) RDO is the best for the following reasons:-"

1.  "Idempotent"
2.  "Best Documentation"
3.  "Helpful forums providing working solutions."

"The work done on Packstack is admirable, this makes us to wonder why someone would want to use DevStack."

"RDO is the upstream version of RHEL OpenStack Platform, the commercial version of OpenStack by Red Hat. During the last months I tried several flavors of OpenStack and while I still think that installing from scratch is the best way to learn, in fact is what I did for my first labs, RDO gives me the possibility to quickly create my testing labs."

# RDO test day Icehouse milestone 2

We plan to hold a RDO test day on February 4th and 5th, 2014. This will be coordinated through the #rdo channel on Freenode, and through this wiki and the rdo-list mailing list.

We'll be testing the second Icehouse milestone release. If you can do any testing on your own ahead of time, that will help ensure that everyone isn't encountering the same problems.

## Who's Participating

rbowen (Rich Bowen) - Test matrix, wiki stuff

## Prerequisites

We plan to have have packages for the following platforms:

*   Fedora 19
*   Fedora 20
*   RHEL 6.5
*   CentOS 6
*   CentOS 6.5

You'll want a fresh install with latest updates installed. (Fresh so that there's no hard-to-reproduce interactions with other things.)

## How to test

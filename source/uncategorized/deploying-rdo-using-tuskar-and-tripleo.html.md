# Deploying RDO using Tuskar and TripleO

The following page describes a process for deploying RDO Havana using the Tuskar [1](https://github.com/openstack/tuskar/) and TripleO [2](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/TripleO) projects.

NOTE: This install process is **NOT** suitable for production deployment, in fact it has **only** been tested as part of a demonstration for the OpenStack Icehouse summit in Hong Kong. The images used are in **NO** way secure and should only be utilized in a private, local environment where they will not be externally reachable.

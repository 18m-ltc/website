# Adding a compute node

Expanding your single-node OpenStack cloud to include a second compute node requires a second network adapter: in order for our pair of nodes to share the same private network, we must replace the "lo" interface we used for the private network with a real nic.

### Edit the answer file

First, you must edit the "answer file" generated during the initial packstack setup. You'll find it in the directory from which you ran packstack.

NOTE: by default $youranswerfile is called packstack-answer-$date-$time.txt

    vi $youranswerfile

If you're not familiar with vi, you may use another editor such as "nano".

#### Adjust network card names

Change both `CONFIG_NOVA_COMPUTE_PRIVIF` and `CONFIG_NOVA_NETWORK_PRIVIF` from `lo` to `eth1` or whatever name your network card uses.

Your second NIC may have a different name. You can find the names of your devices by running:

    ifconfig | grep '^\S'

#### Change IP addresses

Change the value for `CONFIG_NOVA_COMPUTE_HOSTS` from the value of your first host IP address to the value of your second host IP address. Ensure that the key `CONFIG_NOVA_NETWORK_HOSTS` exists and is set to the IP address of your first host.

In case you do not use neutron but rather flat_dhcp nova network, there may be as well a need to change the key `CONFIG_NOVA_NETWORK_HOST` to `CONFIG_NOVA_NETWORK_HOSTS` and provide corresponding IP address.

### Re-run packstack with the new values

Run packstack again, specifying your modified answer file:

NOTE: by default $youranswerfile is called packstack-answer-$date-$time.txt

    sudo packstack --answer-file=$youranswerfile

Packstack will prompt you for the root password for each of your nodes.

## Adding a compute node

Expanding your single-node OpenStack cloud to include a second compute node requires a second network adapter: in order for our pair of nodes to share the same private network, we must replace the "lo" interface we used for the private network with a real nic.

1.  Edit the answer file generated during the initial packstack setup. You'll find it in the directory from which you ran packstack.
    vi $youranswerfile

Change the values for "CONFIG_NOVA_COMPUTE_PRIVIF" and "CONFIG_NOVA_NETWORK_PRIVIF" from "lo" to "eth1" (substitute the correct name for your second nic, if needed)

Change the value for "CONFIG_NOVA_COMPUTE_HOSTS" from "\(YOUR_1st_HOST_IP" to "\)YOUR_1st_HOST_IP,$YOUR_2nd_HOST_IP"

1.  Run packstack again, specifiying your modified answer file:
    sudo packstack --answer-file=$youranswerfile

Packstack will prompt you for the root password for each of your nodes.

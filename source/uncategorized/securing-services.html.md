# Securing services

__NOTOC__

## Overview

The default OpenStack configuration doesn't include securing internal services with SSL. This document provides manual instructions for securing some of the services.

## Preparation

You'll need a CA to issue server certificates, along with the CA certificate itself. Instructions for issuing certificates is beyond the scope of this document, but the subject should include CN=<fqdn> for SSL to work.

Depending on your host configuration, some services may be running on separate machines. Keep this in mind when restarting services.

The location of the certificates is not mandatory, but be aware of SELinux issues if you decide to locate them elsewhere.

It is bad practice to share the same server certificate between services.

### Example IPA Setup

The certmonger puppet modules works with IPA, if you choosenot to manager your own CA server of another kind. Following are some basic directions to get that set up:

#### Set up server

Note that this example uses 192.168.200.x as the OpenStack private network for example purposes, and assumes your IPA server can manage DNS there. Obviously when using such a setup, the configuration options are nearly endless,. This is meant merely to get you started, using the setup we have described [here](Virtualized_Foreman_Dev_Setup). Adjust the values according to your own setup.

Ensure the hostname of your IPA server is the FQDN on the private network:

      echo "$(hostname -s).openstack.priv" > /etc/hostname
      echo "$(hostname -i) $(hostname -s).openstack.priv" >> /etc/hosts
      sed -i "s/^`\(HOSTNAME=\)`.*$/\1$(hostname -s).openstack.priv/" \
         /etc/sysconfig/network
         hostname $(hostname -s).openstack.priv

Instal the IPA server:

      yum install freeipa-server bind bind-dyndb-ldap
      ipa-server-install --setup-dns --forwarder=192.168.200.1 \
        --hostname=$(hostname -s).openstack.priv -r OPENSTACK.PRIV \
        -n openstack.priv -p Secret123 -P Secret123 -a Secret123 -U

Verify the IP for the subnet you are using (192.168.200.1, in our example), is in /etc/resolv.conf.

Create your controller host entry:

      ipa dnsrecord-add openstack.priv v3controller --a-rec=192.168.200.10
       --a-create-reverse

#### On OpenStack Controller

Make sure the ipa server is in resolv.conf (listed first)

Install and configure the IPA client software. If you are using the IPA DNS then the domain and server will be autodiscovered. For authentication you can use the IPA admin user and password.

      yum install ipa-client
      ipa-client-install

If you have dhclient running on your machine(s), you will also want to update the config in /etc/dhcp/dhclient-<nic>.conf to have the line:

      option domain-name-servers 192.168.200.1, `<domain-server-ip-2>`, `<etc>`;

Otherwise dhclient will overwrite /etc/resolv.conf causing DNS resolution to fail.

## MySQL

*   Obtain a server certificate and private key, in PEM format with no password on the private key.

<!-- -->

    # openssl req -out /root/example.csr -new -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout /etc/pki/tls/private/<fqdn>-mysql.key
    # chown mysql  /etc/pki/tls/private/<fqdn>-mysql.key
    # restorecon  /etc/pki/tls/private/<fqdn>-mysql.key

*   Place the certificate file in /etc/pki/tls/certs/<fqdn>-mysql.crt, fix permissions

<!-- -->

    # chown mysql  /etc/pki/tls/certs/<fqdn>-mysql.crt
    # restorecon  /etc/pki/tls/certs/<fqdn>-mysql.crt

*   Place the private key in /etc/pki/tls/private/<fqdn>-mysql.key (if you didn't create it using the step above)
*   Place the CA certificate in /etc/pki/tls/CA/certs/ca.crt
*   Edit /etc/my.conf and point mysqld to the new cert and key:

<!-- -->

    [client]
    ssl_ca=/etc/pki/tls/CA/certs/ca.crt
    ...
    [mysqld]
    ssl_ca=/etc/pki/tls/CA/certs/ca.crt
    ssl_cert=/etc/pki/tls/certs/<fqdn>-mysql.crt
    ssl-key=/etc/pki/tls/private/<fqdn>-mysql.key

*   Restart mysqld:

<!-- -->

    [root@mysql ~]# service mysqld restart

*   Test that SSL is working:

<!-- -->

    [root@mysql ~]# mysql -e "\s"

*   Configure the OpenStack services to use SSL. Set the SQL connection (either connection or sql_connection, depending on the service) . **Note**: that this also changes from addressing the host by IP address to FQDN:

<!-- -->

    connection = mysql://keystone_admin:a3a9e1219b81473e@mysql.example.com/keystone?ssl_ca=/etc/ipa/ca.crt

*   To these files (which may span several hosts):
    -   /etc/glance/glance-api.conf
    -   /etc/glance/glance-registry.conf
    -   /etc/cinder/cinder.conf
    -   /etc/nova/nova.conf
    -   /etc/keystone/keystone.conf

<!-- -->

*   Restart the affected OpenStack services

## qpid

Configuring qpidd does not currently work without making some manual changes, depending on the version of OpenStack you are running. nova and glance do not properly allow SSL configuration due to launchpad bug <https://bugs.launchpad.net/oslo/+bug/1158807> . It is a one-line change to make in the nova and cinder python files.

*   Install the qpid-cpp-server-ssl package

      # yum install qpid-cpp-server-ssl

*   Create a directory to store the NSS certificate database for qpidd

<!-- -->

    # mkdir /etc/pki/qpid
    # certutil -N -d /etc/pki/qpid (note the password you use)

*   Create a password file containing the password you set on the NSS database

<!-- -->

    # echo password > /etc/pki/qpid/password.conf

*   Fix permissions and ownership of files

<!-- -->

    # chown -R qpidd /etc/pki/qpid
    # chmod 600 /etc/pki/qpid/password.conf
    # restorecon /etc/pki/qpid/*

*   Request a certificate from this NSS database. The subject will depend on your PKI infrastructure. The issuing CA may change it.

<!-- -->

    # certutil -R -d /etc/pki/qpid -s "cn=<fqdn>,O=example.com -a

*   Provide this CSR to your CA. You'll get back a certificate, probably in PEM form.
*   Add the server certificate and CA certificate to your NSS database. The nickname(s) you use here are for your purposes. You can use something more descriptive as needed.

<!-- -->

    # certutil -A -n broker -d /etc/pki/qpid -t u,u,u -a -i /path/to/server.crt
    # certutil -A -n CA -d /etc/pki/qpid -t CT,, -a -i /etc/pki/tls/CA/certs/ca.crt
    * Add configuration options to /etc/qpidd.conf
    <pre>
    require-encryption=yes
    ssl-require-client-authentication=no
    ssl-cert-db=/etc/pki/qpid
    ssl-cert-password-file=/etc/pki/qpid/password.conf
    ssl-cert-name=broker
    ssl-port=5671

*   Restart qpid

<!-- -->

    # service qpid restart

*   Configure nova to use ssl in /etc/nova/nova.conf

      qpid_protocol=ssl
      qpid_port=5671

*   Configure cinder to use ssl in /etc/cinder/cinder.conf

      qpid_protocol=ssl
      qpid_port=5671

*   Restart the nova and cinder services

## horizon/dashboard

The actual configuration files may vary greatly depending on the mechanism used to install the Openstack service. These instructions are for a Foreman-managed installation. One may need to vary the configuration file used.

To manually configure the horizon/dashboard service you will need to obtain an SSL server certificate and private key, and the CA certificate in a file.

*   Install the mod_ssl package

      # yum install mod_ssl

*   Modify /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf and add

      Listen 0.0.0.0:443
      SSLEngine on
      SSLCertificateKeyFile /path/to/server.key
      SSLCertificateFile /path/to/server.crt
      SSLCertificateCAFile /path/to/ca.crt

*   Restart httpd

Some care is needed depending on your configuration. You may already have a default VirtualHost configured for port 443. It very much depends on your distribution and how Openstack was installed.

You can optionally remove the listener on port 80, or always forward requests made on the non-secure port to the secure port by adding this to your configuration file and restarting httpd:

      RewriteEngine On
      RewriteCond %{HTTPS} !=on
      RewriteRule ^/?(.*) `[`https://`](https://)`%{SERVER_NAME}/$1 [R,L]

Automating this configuration relies on upstream patch <https://review.openstack.org/49799> . The current horizon puppet module includes a listen_ssl option which makes Apache listen on port 443 but it doesn't require the mod_ssl package or enable the other SSL configuration options.

          ## What is RDO?

            {:.floatright.openstack-distro}
            ![An Openstack Distribution](openstack-distribution.png)

            RDO is a community of people using and deploying OpenStack on CentOS, Fedora, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux. We have [documentation to help get started](Docs), [Mailing lists](Mailing_lists) where you can connect with other users, and [community-supported packages](/install/quickstart/) of the most up-to-date OpenStack releases available for download.

            If you are looking for enterprise-level support, or information on partner certification, Red Hat also offers [Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform](//redhat.com/openstack).

            OpenStack relies on the underlying operating system and hypervisor — and what better operating system to build on than the industry's leading enterprise operating system? The RDO community is your one-stop community site for all things related to using OpenStack on Red Hat based platforms.

          ## RDO Manager

          {:.floatright.rdo-manager-logo}
          [![RDO Manager Logo](rdo-manager-logo.png)](RDO-Manager)

          RDO Manager is an OpenStack installer geared to maximize the utilization of your Openstack infrastructure by adding and decreasing server capacity based on the needs of your Openstack cloud utilization.

          RDO Manager is based on TripleO (Openstack on Openstack) and utilizes the idea of undercloud and overcloud deployments. RDO Manager deploys the undercloud server (One Physical or virtual server) with a basic All-in-One Openstack installation that will in turn, inventory, build, deploy and manage the overcloud (Your Cloud Infrastructure).

          ## Get Involved

          There are many ways to [get involved](get involved) with the RDO community once you [ get started](quickstart). The simplest way is to [head over to the ask.openstack.org forum](http://ask.openstack.org) and help answer questions. Or try out OpenStack for your self right now at [TryStack.org](http://trystack.org/).

          The Puppet modules used in packstack are on [Github](https://github.com/packstack) and packstack itself is on [Stackforge](https://github.com/stackforge/packstack).

          For a commercially-supported enterprise ready OpenStack solution, Red Hat provides [Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform](//www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/openstack-platform), an enterprise-class cloud platform based on OpenStack.

# Cinder

Marker

## January 2014 Test Day

The general idea for the Cinder's test is to test the actions of the component in different environments and with different back ends. Cinder should be able to do the following actions with each back end and in every topology:

*   Create a volume (simple creation, from an image, from a snapshot and a copy of another volume).
*   Delete a volume.
*   Create a snapshot.
*   Delete a snapshot.
*   Upload the volume to an image.
*   Backup the volume.
*   Attach/ detach the volume from an instance.

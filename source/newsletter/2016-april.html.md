## Join us at OpenStack Summit!

[OpenStack Summit](https://www.openstack.org/summit/austin-2016/) is
just days away now, and we're looking forward to seeing you there.
We'll have a pod in the Red Hat booth, D1. We have a number of demos
lined up, of how people are using RDO in their organizations. If you'e
like to share your RDO experience with the world, please [drop me a
note](mailto:rbowen@redhat.com) and we'll get you on the schedule.

Also, join us [Tuesday night on Rainey
street](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/stackcity-austin-a-community-festival-for-stackers-tickets-24174378216)
for the official OpenStack Summit Community Party. (You do need to
register ahead of time. Must be 21 to attend. IDs will be checked at
the door.) RDO will be at [Bangers](http://www.bangersaustin.com/)
with Red Hat. Drop by and get your [RDO
duck](https://www.rdoproject.org/blog/2015/10/ducks/).

RDO is also [well
represented](http://redhatstackblog.redhat.com/2016/03/16/red-hat-confirms-over-35-sessions-at-openstack-summit-austin-have-a-look/)
in the conference schedule, so if you want to learn more about
OpenStack in general, and RDO in particular, this is definitely the
place to be!

See you there!

## Delorean is now DLRN

Article from APevec goes here

## all openstack packages have now test packages

Can Chandan point me to source for this?

## Mitaka release next week

The OpenStack Mitaka release is [almost
here](http://releases.openstack.org/mitaka/schedule.html) and the RDO
Mitaka packages will follow close behind. We'll be doing another test
day to make sure that it's the best RDO release yet, and we could use
your help. You can find details about the test day on the [Mitaka GA
Test Day](https://www.rdoproject.org/testday/mitaka/ga) page. As
usual, we'll be in #rdo on the Freenode IRC network for questions and
conversation.

## Brno on-site test day

Speaking of test days, during the Mitaka Milestone 3 test day, we held
our first-ever on-site test day event at the Red Hat Brno office. We
had about 15 engineers in attendance, and they felt it was a big
success, so we'll probably do this again. If you'd like to host an
on-site test day at your office, please [let me know](mailto:rbowen@redhat.com) so that I can
help get the word out.

## Upcoming Hangout

On Friday, April 8th, at [14:00
UTC](http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converted.html?iso=20160408T14&p1=0&p2=848),
Dmitry Tantsur will be hosting a [Google
Hangout](https://plus.google.com/events/cs6n7g4uihrap7ua4dt52vsdjfo)
where he will be discussing the recent work on Ironic, and what will
be included in the Mitaka release.

If you can't make it at that time, the event will be recorded, and
will be available at that same location afterwards.

You can watch any of our past hangouts on [the RDO
website](http://rdoproject.org/community/hangouts/). If you would like
to present a hangout about your RDO experiences, please speak up on
[this thread on
rdo-list](https://www.redhat.com/archives/rdo-list/2016-April/msg00001.html).

## Other events

Other RDO events, including the many OpenStack meetups around the
world, are always listed at http://rdoproject.org/events  If you have
an RDO-related event, please feel free to add it by submitting a pull
request to
https://github.com/rbowen/rh-events/blob/master/2016/RDO-Meetups.yml

If you are hosting or attending a meetup, please let me know, so that
I can help you spread the word to the larger community.

## Community Meetings 

Every Wednesday at 15:00 UTC, we have the weekly RDO community meeting
on the #RDO channel on Freenode IRC. And at 15:00 UTC Thursdays, we
have the CentOS Cloud SIG Meeting on #centos-devel. The notes from
these meetings are posted each week [on the community
page](/community/#discuss).

If you would like to participate in the RDO community, attending these
meetings is an excellent way to find out where you can help, or to
tell the rest of the community what you'd like to work on.

## Bug Statistics 

Chandan Kumar has for some time been posting weekly bug statistics summaries.
These are great for tracking the progress of the project, and are also
an excellent place to look if you're getting started and looking for
something to start working on.

You can see the latest of these messages [in the mailing list
archive](https://www.redhat.com/archives/rdo-list/2016-March/msg00185.html).

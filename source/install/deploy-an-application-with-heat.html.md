# Deploy an Application with OpenStack Heat

This guide deploys a composite application (made up of more than a single instance) on the cloud infrastructure. This also involves launch-time customization of the VMs. This guide makes some assumptions:

*   OpenStack, including Heat have been deployed, using either [ RDO Havana](DeployHeatOnHavana) or [ RDO Grizzly](Deploy_Heat_and_launch_your_first_Application) instructions
*   OpenStack is deployed on RHEL 6.4 or Fedora 19

### Get the demo files

It is time now to launch your first multi-instance cloud application! There are a number of sample templates available in the [heat-templates](https://github.com/openstack/heat-templates) git repo.

First, download the composed Wordpress example with::

`$ wget `[`https://raw.github.com/openstack/heat-templates/master/cfn/F17/WordPress_Composed_Instances.template`](https://raw.github.com/openstack/heat-templates/master/cfn/F17/WordPress_Composed_Instances.template)

Next, register a pre-built cfntools image with glance. Note the command automatically downloads the image. For reference, pre-built Fedora images are available from: <https://getfedora.org/cloud/download/>.

`$ glance image-create --name Fedora-Cloud-Base-20141203-21.x86_64 --disk-format qcow2 --container-format bare --is-public True --copy-from `[`http://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/fedora/linux/releases/21/Cloud/Images/x86_64/Fedora-Cloud-Base-20141203-21.x86_64.qcow2`](http://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/fedora/linux/releases/21/Cloud/Images/x86_64/Fedora-Cloud-Base-20141203-21.x86_64.qcow2)

Upload your public key in nova to make sure you'll be able to login on the VMs using SSH::

      $ nova keypair-add --pub_key ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub userkey

Some templates require the instances to be able to connect to the heat CFN API, so it would be a good idea to add a chain to iptables to accept connection to 8000 and 8003 ports so that the guests can communicate with the heat-api-cfn server and heat-api-cloudwatch server. You can append to your `/etc/sysconfig/iptables` ::

      $ -A INPUT -i br100 -p tcp --dport 8000 -j ACCEPT
      $ -A INPUT -i br100 -p tcp --dport 8003 -j ACCEPT

where `br100` is the interface of the bridge that your instances are using.

### Launch!

It is time for the real fun now, launch your first composed application with::

      $ heat stack-create wordpress --template-file=WordPress_Composed_Instances.template --parameters="DBUsername=wp;DBPassword=wp;KeyName=userkey;LinuxDistribution=F17"

More parameters could have passed, note for instance the LinuxDistribution parameter discussed above. Now the interesting stuff:

      $ heat stack-list
      $ heat event-list wordpress

After the VMs are launched, the mysql/httpd/wordpress installation and configuration begins, the process is driven by the `cfntools`, installed in the VMs images. It will take quite some time, despite the `event-list` reporting completion for the WordPress install too early (there is signaling, via `cfn-signal`, only in the MySQL template). You can login on the instances and check the logs or just use `ps` to see how things are going. After some minutes the setup should be finished:

      $ heat stack-show wordpress
      $ wget ${WebsiteURL} # that is an URL from the previous command!

If anything goes wrong, check the logs at `/var/log/heat/engine.log` or look at the scripts passed as `UserData` to the instances, these should be found in `/var/lib/cloud/data/`. Time to hack your very own template and delete the test deployment! :)

# Installing and Configuring RDO

[ ‚Üê Docs](Docs)

For an initial test deployment, follow the [Packstack quickstart](/install/quickstart). While using Packstack is sufficient as a proof-of-concept, there are other ways that you can use to deploy OpenStack with RDO. If you need to deploy a production-ready cloud, possibly with HA, see the [TripleO quickstart](/tripleo).

Documents on this page also cover configuring your deployment.

# Running an Instance

### Step 1: Visit the Dashboard

Log in to the Openstack dashboard at <http://CONTROL_NODE/dashboard> - the username is "demo". The password can be found in the file keystonerc_demo in the /root/ directory of the control node.

**Note: make sure you use the "demo" username here.**

### Step 2: Enable SSH and ICMP on your default security group.

Once logged in to the OpenStack dashboard, click the "Project" tab in the left-side navigation menu, and then click "Access & Security" (http://$YOURIP/dashboard/project/access_and_security/) under the heading "Manage Compute." Under the "Security Groups" heading, click the " Edit Rules" button for the "default" security group. Click the "Add Rule" button, and in the resulting dialog, enter "22" in the "Port" field, and then click the "Add" button. Add another rule selecting ICMP as the protocol and entering-1 for both the type and the code field.

Optionally, from the command line, instead of using horizon:

    source /root/keystonerc_demo
    neutron security-group-rule-create --protocol icmp --direction ingress default
    neutron security-group-rule-create --protocol tcp --port-range-min 22 --port-range-max 22 --direction ingress default

### Step 3: Create or import a key pair.

In the left-side navigation menu, click "Access & Security" under the heading "Manage Compute." In the main portion of the screen, click the tab labeled "Keypairs," and choose either to "Create Keypair" or "Import Keypair." The "Create Keypair" dialog will prompt you to supply a keypair name before downloading a private key to your client. To use the downloaded keypair, you will need to properly set its permissions:

    chmod 600 /path/to/keypair.pem

Optionally, from the command line:

    nova keypair-add KEY_NAME > MY_KEY.pem && chmod 600 MY_KEY.pem

The "Import Keypair" option will prompt you to provide a name and a public key to use with an existing private key on your client. For name, choose something to identify that key (like your username, for example) and for key, use the contents of your public key file, usually in ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub or ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub on the machine from which you will be ssh-ing in.

from the command line:

    nova keypair-add --pub_key ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub KEY_NAME

### Step 4: Launch the instance.

In the main portion of the screen, under the "Images" heading, click the "Launch" button for the "cirros" image. In the resulting dialog, provide a name in the "Instance Name" field. Under the "Network" tab, add the "private" network and click the "Launch" button.

### Step 5: Associate Floating IP

In the main portion of the screen, under the "Instances" heading, click the "More" button, followed by the "Associate Floating IP" link for the instance you just launched. Click the "+" by the "IP Address" field. Select "Allocate IP". Now, select "Associate". You should see both public and private IP addresses listed in the "IP Address" column for your instance. It may take a little while for the IP address to show up.

For additional details, please read [how to set a floating IP range](Floating IP range).

### Step 6: SSH to Your Instance

Using the key pair file from step 3, ssh into the running vm using its floating ip address:

    $ ssh -l cirros -i my_key_pair.pem floating_ip_address

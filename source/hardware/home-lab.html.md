# Home lab

__NOTOC__

## Hardware for a home lab

A frequent request is: how can I install and configure a small OpenStack cloud for personal use, with cheap, quiet PCs I can keep in a home office. A typical hardware configuration would be three or more hosts, with one host serving as control node, and the others as compute nodes.

This page is for community hardware recommendations - if you have a home lab you're happy with, list hardware specs here and share prices.

### Micro-ATX hosts

Doing a lab with Micro-ATX instead of the Shuttle form factor saves money, at the cost of heat.

*   Micro-ATX case & motherboard
*   Quad core 2 GHz AMD Athlon processor
*   8GB SDRAM
*   1TB 7200 RPM SATA hard drive
*   2 Gb ethernet cards

Estimated cost per node: $275

By adding SSDs, the price goes up, but the noise and heat go down.

### HP Micro servers

Several people have suggested Gen8 or N54L HP Proliant servers.

*   Max RAM is 16GB (N54L)
*   4 drive pays allow for lots of (potentially noisy) storage. 8 drive possible in 2.5".
*   Start at about $180 (more if you want more RAM)
